      <h2>Product Description</h2>
      <p>The Caring by Nature makeup remover and skin cleansing set is your
        complete solution to purify and prepare your skin, letting you get the
        most from your skin care products.</p>
      <p>Make your skin cleansing routine super easy by using first: the soft
        and gentle face cloth, that removes makeup and impurities thoroughly
        from your skin with a gentle swipe, which works great with just warm water.</p>
      <p>Second: using the bamboo rounds that are ideal to use with micellar
        water, cleansing milk or tonner.</p>
      <p>Lastly: use the laundry bag if you choose to machine wash or simply
        wash with warm soapy water straight after use. Once dry, reduce clutter,
        mess and save space by storing in the handy cotton drawstring storage bag.</p>

      <p>Our cloths and pads are double sided, giving you double the surface to
        work with. They are also gently tinted, meaning less stains, easier wash
        and even longer fresh look and feel. Your skin will benefit from this easy
        addition or replacement to your current routine, and our planet will
        benefit from less waste. This set is durable and guaranteed to last for
        1000s of uses, is plastic free and biodegradable, therefore not leaving
        a negative footprint on the future. Bamboo fabric is not only known to
        produce supremely soft luxurious fabric, it is also more environmentally
        friendly, requiring far less water to maintain crops of bamboo when
        compared to cotton.</p>

      <p>1% for our Planet – don’t forget, 1% of profits from each sale will be
        donated to environmental causes, so you’ll be not only caring for your
        skin but also for our Planet!</p>
